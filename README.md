To display an item do `/displayitem [NAME]` followed by a name for the item. You also need to hold an item in your hand wich isn't air.
You can also use [hex colors](https://g.co/kgs/4XwXScb) and [default colors](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/minecraft-color-codes/).
Example: 

```
/displayitem #bc6eccD#ad60bdr#a254b3a#9748a8g#883c99o#803191n #6d247dE#5d1b6bg#4f145cg
